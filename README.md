## 🪶 **Product Name:** Lipi

*(“Lipi” means ‘script’ or ‘writing’ in Sanskrit — elegant, meaningful, and tech-sound)*

### **Tagline:**

> **“Write. Think. Collaborate — Privately.”**

Alternative variants for marketing copy:

* “The intelligent, encrypted workspace for modern teams.”
* “Google Docs reinvented for the AI age — with privacy built in.”

---

## 🌍 **Product Overview:**

**Lipi** is an **AI-powered, privacy-first document editor** that combines the intelligence of ChatGPT, the fluid editing of Notion, and the collaboration of Google Docs — wrapped in full end-to-end encryption and offline support.

It’s the first writing tool designed for creators, founders, and teams who value both **productivity and privacy** — where your ideas stay yours.

---

## ⚙️ **Core Concept:**

A web-based document workspace that allows users to:

* Write using **Notion-style block editing**
* Collaborate in real-time with **comments and approvals**
* Use **inline AI commands** like `/summarize`, `/rewrite`, `/expand`
* Work **fully offline** and sync seamlessly later
* Store and share documents with **zero-knowledge encryption** — even the servers can’t read them

All content, comments, and history are **encrypted on your device before it ever touches the cloud**.

---

## 💡 **Why Lipi Exists:**

Existing tools like Google Docs and Notion trade privacy for convenience.
They read your content, index your data, and offer minimal AI support.
Lipi flips that model — giving you **AI superpowers without surveillance**.
